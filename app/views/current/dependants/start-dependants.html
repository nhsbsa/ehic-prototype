      }) }}

      <p>Use this service to:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>check if you're eligible and apply for cover</li>
         <li>replace a lost, stolen, or damaged card</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you're eligible, you'll receive a card that can be used to get cover for emergency treatment abroad. This will be either a:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</li>
         <li>UK European Health Insurance Card (new UK EHIC), if you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We'll let you know what you're entitled to during your application. </p>

      <h2>What these cover</h2>

      <p>Both cards give you access to state-provided healthcare abroad for things like: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>emergency treatment </li>
         <li>visits to A&E </li>
         <li>routine maternity care, unless you're <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/giving-birth-outside-the-uk/" target="_blank">going abroad to give birth (opens in a new tab)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both cards provide the same cover but the countries they are valid in can change. Check our website to see
         <a href="/nhs-bsa/countries" target="_blank">where you can use each card (opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>


      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
         <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
         <p>A UK EHIC or UK GHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. You should make sure that you have travel insurance as well as a UK EHIC or UK GHIC.</p>

            <p>A Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) will entitle you to the same level of cover as a UK GHIC or

               UK EHIC and it has not arrived yet. </p>
            <p>You can only apply for a PRC from the time you need treatment. A PRC can provide cover for treatment that
               has already taken place, but one cannot be issued in advance. </p>
